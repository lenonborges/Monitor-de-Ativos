# Trend Tracker
This script was meant to help investors finding securities (brazilian equities, for now but can be applied to other securities exchanges, cryptos and etc)
which have been trading on a trend for long/mid time and had suffered some correction in the short time, presenting a trading opportunity for trend followers. 
The script here is a MVP of a personal project, to be honest, and wasn't optimized yet with Oriented Object programming paradigm and isn't ready for deployment.
